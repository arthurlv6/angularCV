        <h3>My development philosophy</h3>
        <h4>
            1, Customers' evaluation is the only standard for the developer. Never forget your manager is your kind of customer.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            2, Try to use new techniques while freshing and solidifying basic concepts.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            3, If you care enough, everything is possible. The more projects that you develop, the more experience you will get for yourself not others.
        </h4>
