In New Zealand many retail companies offer wonderful products and allow their customers to pay for it weekly or fortnightly. So you can imagine they have thousands of customers and contracts need to handle and how to effectively manage their accounts is a big challenge for them. Therefore my system was born and it perfectly solved those problems. The system enable retailers to trace customers' payment plans and notice them to delivery or repossess their products. The system mainly include three part named customer maintenance, contract management and bank statement management. The contract management is key of the system and others are around it because it associate with other parts like customer, statement, products, repossession, delivery and so on. Finally, my customer (company website: www.goodvalue.co.nz) has already used this system for a while and they are happy and satisfied in this practical and powerful system. ">
